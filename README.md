# Image Colorization


In this project, I base myself on the [Deep Koalarization: Image Colorization usingCNNs and Inception-Resnet-v2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03400.pdf) paper to implement a neural network to colorize black and white images.

It can be found in the Google colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TyucCZk7vnoemL2SM_W9ukVnrWK8YvmD) or as an .ipynb in this repository.

The data I use to train and test the network can be found [here](https://www.floydhub.com/emilwallner/datasets/colornet/2).

I will train and test it on another data set and ulpoad the results soon enough.

I'm also preparing a clean .py version.
